          I followed a standard course until the second, then I joined the STI2D
          in first and final. After missing my baccalaureate the first time, I
          did my year again and graduated. I continued in the current training
          which is the BUT Networks and Telecommunications after having worked
          the summer holidays in the optical fiber at «Circet distribution»
          where I acquired professional experience and some notions on the
          subject. My project is to continue this formation in DevCloud and
          alternating from the second year while continuing to work every summer

            I choose STI2D because I have always been more attracted
            through technology subjects, college through math and
            technology, in second by math and the CIT option (creation and
            technological innovation). I enjoyed overall the sector put to
            We had little practice and a lot of theory.
            It is for these reasons that this R&T GOAL caught my attention, it is
            technological training, with theory and quite a bit of practice
            also what I lacked in STI2D.
