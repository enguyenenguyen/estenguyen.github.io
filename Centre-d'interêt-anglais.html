            Clothes, fashion, style including streetwear fascinates me. My
            curiosity particularly attracts me to clothing brands
            independent, their new designs or their new releases. My
            first occupation is to find shops and brands
            independent, often in streetwear style, and to be interested in
            their design and their ways to get there or simply
            find clothes I like to get them.

            The system of these brands is also attractive, indeed their
            is special because it works in the form of
            drop, due to the fact that they have limited stocks due to their notoriety.
            This system seduces me even more than traditional customs because
            few people can get the same items as me, which makes
            some rarer pieces.

            What is a drop? It is the opening or temporary sale of
            products, articles or collections because they are in limited edition.
            Generally, these are announced on social networks or by
            ads and the opening date varies depending on the drops, it
            can be 10 minutes or several weeks.

            I find it exciting to create a brand in its entirety,
            invent, draw, realize design with for example photoshop in
            looking for what is not yet done on the market and what is
            what we still do not see or little, find and choose the right
            suppliers, decide on a production and storage location for
            products, seeking funding, defining the identity of the
            brand, name, logo, create an online store and finally put
            in place a communication and advertising strategy.
